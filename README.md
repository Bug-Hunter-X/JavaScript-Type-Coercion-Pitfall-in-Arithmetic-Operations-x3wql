This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug stemming from loose typing and type coercion during arithmetic operations. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, showcasing how passing a string to a function expecting a number leads to unexpected `NaN` results.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using explicit type checking or conversion to prevent this type of error. This example highlights the importance of robust type handling in JavaScript to avoid runtime surprises and ensure code reliability.
